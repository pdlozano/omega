    What you're looking for either doesn't exist or you
    followed a broken link. Either way, have this dad joke from an
    API:
</p>
<p id="joke"></p>

<script>
    const joke = document.getElementById("joke");
    fetch("https://icanhazdadjoke.com/", {
        headers: {
            Accept: "application/json",
        },
    })
            .then((res) => res.json())
            .then((res) => joke.textContent = res.joke);
</script>
